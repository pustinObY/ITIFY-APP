    <h5 class="privacy__head">16. Termination</h5>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either
      you or ChatGPT. You may terminate these Terms of Service as they apply to
      you at any time by ceasing to use the app. ChatGPT may terminate these
      Terms of Service at any time immediately and without notice, and
      accordingly deny you access to the app, for any reason in its sole
      discretion; however, the provisions in these Terms of Service that relate
      to intellectual property, indemnification, disclaimer, limitation of
      liability, and choice of law shall survive any termination of these Terms
      of Service.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h5 class="privacy__head">17. Entire Agreement</h5>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service (together with our Privacy Policy, which is
      expressly incorporated herein by reference and which can be accessed on
      this app, and any other terms that may appear on the app from
      time-to-time) contain the entire understanding and agreement between you
      and ChatGPT with respect to your use and access of this app, and supersede
      all prior agreements, terms, conditions and understandings, both written
      and oral, with respect to such use and access of the app. No
      representation, statement or inducement, whether oral or written, not
      contained in these Terms of Service (and any other terms that may appear
      on the app from time-to-time) or the Privacy Policy shall bind any party
      to this agreement. No additional or different terms or conditions will be
      binding upon us unless expressly agreed to in writing by an officer of
      ChatGPT. No other representative has any authority to waive, alter, vary
      or add to these Terms of Service. Before using this app please read
      through all referenced documents carefully.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h5 class="privacy__head">18. Severability</h5>
    <p>
      If any portion of these Terms of Service is held to be invalid or
      unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable portion shall be modified in
      accordance with the applicable law with a provision that most closely
      reflects the intention of the original provision, and the remainder of
      these Terms of Service shall remain in full force and effect. The failure
      of ChatGPT to insist upon or enforce strict performance by you of any
      provision of these Terms of Service shall not be construed as a waiver of
      any provision or right.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h5 class="privacy__head">19. Changes to our Terms of Service</h5>
    <p>
      We may revise and update these Terms of Service from time to time at our
      sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them,
      and apply to all access to and use of the app thereafter. However, any
      changes to the dispute resolution provisions set forth in Governing Law
      and Jurisdiction and Arbitration above will not apply to any disputes for
      which the parties have actual notice on or prior to the date the change is
      posted on the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your continued use of the app following the posting of revised Terms of
      Service means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected
      to check this page from time to time so you are aware of any changes, as
      they are binding on you.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h5 class="privacy__head">
      20. Notice of Changes and Use of Terms of Service
    </h5>
    <p>
      We may provide notice to you relating to the app and/or these Terms of
      Service by sending an email to your last known email address, and any such
      notice shall be deemed given and received on the day it is sent. A printed
      version of these Terms of Service and of any notice given to you in
      electronic form or otherwise shall be admissible in judicial or
      administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of
      Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other
      business documents and records originally generated and maintained in
      printed form. You agree that any cause of action that you may desire to
      bring arising out of or related to these Terms of Service and/or the app
      must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arises. You
      may not use the app or export the Content in violation of Vietnam export
      laws and regulations. If you access the app from a location outside of
      Vietnam, you are responsible for compliance with all local laws.
